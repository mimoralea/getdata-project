# Getting and Cleaning data
## Course Project
_Miguel Morales_

The R script `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The file `CookBook.md` shows the details about the commands used to get and clean the dataset.

The file `tidy.txt` contains the output dataset of the mean values per subject, activity and variable being measured.

The folder `dataset` constain the Samsung data.
